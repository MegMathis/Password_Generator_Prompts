# Password Generator Prompts

## Description

This password generator application is used to scramble upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. I used JavaScript to accomplish this task. The password generator prompts you with the following:

<li> Must contain 8-128 characters </li>
<li> Do you want Upper Case Letters? </li>
<li> Do you want Lower Case Letters? </li>
<li> Do you want Numbers? </li>
<li> Do you want special characters </li>

After all selections have been made, a password is generated in the box.

## Usage

1. Open in browser
2. Click generate password
3. Follow prompts
